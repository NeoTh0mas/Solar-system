# Solar-system
This program immitates the real movement of planets in the Solar system.
All needed parameters of planets such as radii, weights, distances and so on are considered and derived from official sources
The movement is calculated in real time by using Newton's gravitational force formula
The graphics are implemented with pygame module
The speed is controlled by the left and the right buttons on the keyboard, moreover the scale is also can be changed by using up and down buttons

WTF is that, I don't have a clue how this code works, I just copied it from the youtube tutorial and that's it
